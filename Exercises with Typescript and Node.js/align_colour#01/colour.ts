  //Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of
  // 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just
// earned 5 points.
// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
// (The version that fails will have no output.)
    
    // test whether the alien’s color is green or not//

    // part 01//

let alienColor1:string= 'green';
if( alienColor1=='green'){
