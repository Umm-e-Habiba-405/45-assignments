// Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the
// results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
// Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
//More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more 
//comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//Tests for equality and inequality with strings
//Tests using the lower case function
//Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, 
//and less than or equal to
//Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//Test whether an item is in a array
//Test whether an item is not in a array
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
//check a is equal to 10//
console.log("Is a equal to 10? I predict True");
console.log(a == 10);
//check b is equal to 20//
console.log("Is b eqaual to 20? I predict True");
console.log(b == 20);
//check a is graterthan b//
console.log("Is a graterthan b?I predict False");
console.log(a > b);
//check b is graterthan a//
console.log("Is b greaterthan a? I predict False");
console.log(b < a);
//check a is greterthan and equal to b//
console.log("Is a graterthanand equal to b?I predict False");
console.log(a >= b);
////check a is graterthan 30//
console.log("Is b greaterthan and equal to a? I predict False");
console.log(a > 30);
//check b is graterthan 30//
console.log("Is a is not equal to b? I predict False");
console.log(b > 30);
// check a is multiply by 2 and equal to b//
console.log("Is a multiply by 2 and equal to b? I peridict True ");
console.log(a * 2 == b);
// check b is minus 10 and equal to a//
console.log("Is b minus 10 and equal to a? I peridict True ");
console.log(b - 10 == a);
//check a graterthan 5//
console.log("Is a graterthen 5? I predict True");
console.log(a > 5);
